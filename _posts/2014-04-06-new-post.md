When I wanna checkout golang's source code, I install hg first.

But I encounter this error.

~~~
clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]
~~~

In the final, I solve this problem by 

~~~

ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future brew install hg

~~~
